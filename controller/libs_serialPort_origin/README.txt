The rxtx libraries used in BotMate have been downloaded from "CMU-CREATE-Lab/commons-java" GitHub repository, commit 826a13121828fb76de4196d7bc9a1501faecb0ad:
https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/commons-java/tree/826a13121828fb76de4196d7bc9a1501faecb0ad/java/lib/rxtx

This directory has .zipped version of this directory in case the repo goes down.

If found these rxtx version by following:
blog.iharder.net/2009/08/18/rxtx-java-6-and-librxtxserial-jnilib-on-intel-mac-os-x/#comment-130660
which in turn I found by debugging issues with previous rxtx lib versions.

The good thing about this rxtx binary is that it works on OS X El Capitan (v10.11) with JDK 8 without problems.

For more details, see the README file in the .zipped file.
